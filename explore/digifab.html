      <p class="lead">"DigiFab" at HSBNE is short for Digital Fabrication, and it is a community-led initiative that involves the use of digital technologies to create physical objects. It covers various fields, including 3D printing, laser cutting, and electronics manufacturing.</p>
      <p>At HSBNE, DigiFab provides members with access to state-of-the-art digital fabrication equipment, software, and training. This allows individuals and teams to design, prototype, and manufacture a wide range of items, from simple parts and components to complex machines and systems.</p>
      <p>Members can learn new skills, collaborate on projects, and share knowledge and experience in a supportive and innovative environment. By promoting digital fabrication, HSBNE helps to drive the development and application of these technologies in Brisbane, providing a valuable resource for hobbyists, artists, entrepreneurs, and anyone interested in the exciting possibilities of digital making.</p>

      <h3>Laser Cutter</h3>
      <p>A CO2 laser cutter is a type of digital fabrication tool that uses a carbon dioxide laser to cut, engrave, or mark materials. The laser generates a high-intensity beam of infrared light, which is directed onto the material surface using mirrors. The energy of the laser beam heats, melts, or vaporizes the material, resulting in a precise and clean cut or engraving.</p>

      <h3>Bamboo Carbon X1 3D Printer</h3>
      <p>A 3D printer is a device that creates three-dimensional objects from digital models by depositing layers of material, typically plastic or resin, in a process known as additive manufacturing. The digital model is sliced into thin layers using software, and the 3D printer follows these instructions to build the object layer by layer.</p>
