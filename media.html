    <h3>The HSBNE Brand</h3>
    <p>
      When talking informally, we generally refer to the group or the physical location as HSBNE or "The Space". HSBNE stands for <strong>H</strong>acker<strong>S</strong>pace <strong>B</strong>risba<strong>NE</strong>, but we typically do not use
      the longer term. While we are modelled on and identify with the hackerspace model, we find
      it difficult to continually work to redefine the word 'hacker' back from the general misrepresentation. Think of "hack" meaning "life hacks".
    </p>
    <p>
      When talking legally, we are HSBNE Inc, as stated on all our incorporation forms, ABN registry's
      etc and so on.

    <h4>Hackerspace</h4>
    <p>
			A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or hackspace) is a community-operated
			physical space where people with common interests can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.
			Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops, workshops
			and/or studios where people can come together to share resources & knowledge to build and make anything.
    </p>
    <h4>HSBNE</h4>
    <p>
HSBNE inc is Brisbane’s largest community workshop and maker collective. As Australia’s oldest hackerspace, it brings together the community, space & tools for anyone to learn how to build their ideas, from hobbyists & students to professionals & startups.
