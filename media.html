    <h3>The HSBNE Brand</h3>
    <p>
      When talking informally, we generally refer to the group or the physical location as HSBNE.
      In the case of disambiguation, the physical location can be referred to as "The Space" or 
      "The Port Hack Campus". HSBNE stands for <strong>H</strong>acker<strong>S</strong>pace <strong>B</strong>risba<strong>NE</strong>, but we typically do not use
      the longer term. While we are modelled on and identify with the hackerspace model, we find
      it difficult to continually work to redefine the word 'hacker' back from the general misrepresentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When talking legally, we are HSBNE Inc, as stated on all our incorporation forms, ABN registry's
      etc and so on.

    <h3>Quotables, Summaries etc</h3>
    <h4>Hackerspace</h4>
    <p>
			A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or hackspace) is a community-operated
			physical space where people with common interests can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.
			Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops, workshops
			and/or studios where people can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make anything.
    </p>
    <h4>HSBNE</h4>
    <p>
    HSBNE is Australia's first Hackerspace, and one of the physically biggest in the world. They
    provide a campus with a growing wealth of tools, large and small, to allow anyone to build and create.
    A membership funded community organisation, HSBNE is open to anyone to tinker and invent. Encouraging
    people to understand how the technology in their daily lives works, and the value in repurposing broken
    equipment.
