<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>HSBNE has grown to a size where tracking our assets has become critical for financial
and safety reasons.</p>

<h2 id="human-version">Human Version</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Assets need to be
    <ul>
      <li>Documented in the wiki,</li>
      <li>Be tested and tagged</li>
      <li>In the asset register</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Donâ€™t throw broken things in the bin, they need to go through end-of-lifecycle so we can
make sure its not repairable and strike it from registers as broken.</li>
  <li>When we sell things, it has to go to a vote where we decide the price, where the proceeds
go, etc.</li>
  <li>Once sold, all money has to go through the treasurer to be properly accounted.</li>
  <li>Donations have to be accepted or rejected by executive or team leads.</li>
  <li>Members must wait for explicit rejection to claim donations.</li>
  <li>The person accepting a donation is responsible for the item. That means they have to follow
through and get it working, installed, WAD etc. (Or find someone who will).</li>
  <li>Loaned items need to have an agreement signed so that everyone is clear on expectations.</li>
  <li>Loaned items may be considered abandoned if the owner becomes uncontactable.</li>
</ul>
