**Description:**

"Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments." [http://www.arduino.cc](http://www.arduino.cc "www.arduino.cc")

This series will introduce you to the Arduino and provide you with some of the basic skills needed to get you up and running. It is intended for users who have little or no experience with electronics or software.

It is a hands on course and active participation is required! Each class in the series will include a practical component where you will program your own Arduino.

**Duration:**

The 'Introduction to Arduino' course is going to be run as a Saturday morning class that will guide you through the process, from getting your computer setup to building simple electronics to use with your Arduino.

The course will run from 9AM until 12:30pm. We will then break for lunch and the afternoon can be used to work on projects, discuss specific problems and generally play with the Arduino.

**Requirements:**

To complete this course, you will need to have access to a computer and an Arduino. It is preferable that you bring your own laptop with you and set it up as your programming environment.

However, if you do not have access to a laptop, HSBNE has desktop PC’s available for use while you are at the space and once you have attended the course, you are welcome to join the Hackerspace and make continuing use of the equipment available on site.

**Cost:**

To cover the cost of hosting the course, each session will be charged at $20 (to be confirmed). This includes the electronic components you will need for the specific projects in each class.

Non-members are welcome to attend, but are required to pay an additional visitors fee of $5 per class (to be confirmed) to subsidise the cost of the space.

In addition, you will need to purchase a beginner’s Arduino kit or bring your own equivalent along.

The recommended starters kit is: Freetronics Experimenters Kit

**The minimum requirements are:**

 - 1 x Arduino-compatible board with USB cable (preferably compatible with the Eleven)
 - 1 X USB cable
 - 1 x Solderless breadboard
 - Solderless breadboard jumper wires
 - 2 x red LEDs
 - 1 x Tactile push buttons
 - 1 X 10k Variable resistor (Potentiometer)

**We will provide:**

- 1 X Power Transistor (2n7000 or equivalent)
- A selection of resistors
