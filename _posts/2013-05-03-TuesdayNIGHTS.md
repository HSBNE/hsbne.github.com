We're open from 5pm every Tuesday to the public, come along and check us out! 

HSBNE Inc is Hackerspace Brisbane. We're a membership based community
organisation that exists so that anyone can build, create and learn.

We're a core part of maker culture, and we're here to help the tinkerer,
the inventor, the small business, the mad scientist, but most
mportantly: the curious.
