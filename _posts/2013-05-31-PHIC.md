[Brisbane Makes Competition entry](http://www.brisbanemakes.com/index.php/projects-entered/6-port-hack-interactive-clock "Brisbane MAKES ")


We came up with the creative ways to put other peoples ideas together to make an interesting and functionl clock. We found a peace of chipboard and started cutting it into the shape we desired.

We needed to get the edge around the hole thiner so we used a router to modify the depth of the round hole in the middle for the clock to sit in.

We decided to make the clock look more hackery we would glue random pcb's form our bone yard.
