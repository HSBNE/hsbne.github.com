		<h3>What's a Hackerspace?</h3>
			<p>
			A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or hackspace) is a community-operated
			physical space where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science,
			digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate.
			</p>
			<p>
			Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops, workshops
			and/or studios where hackers can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things.
			</p>
			<p>
			In general, hackerspaces function as centers for peer learning and knowledge sharing, in the form of
			workshops, presentations, and lectures. They usually also offer social activities for their members,
			such as game nights and parties. They typically provide space for members to work on their individual
			projects, or to collaborate on group projects with other members.
			</p>
			<p>
			In addition to space, most hackerspaces provide electrical power, computer servers and networking
			with Internet connectivity. Well-equipped hackerspaces may provide machine tools, audio equipment,
			video projectors, game consoles, electronic instrumentation (such as oscilloscopes and signal generators),
			electronic components and raw materials for hacking, and various other tools for electronics
			fabrication and building things.
			</p>

		<h3>How does HSBNE operate?</h3>
			<p>
			HSBNE Inc is Australia's first Hackerspace, and one of the physically biggest in the world. We operate
			as an Incorporated Not-for-profit club, and we're funded by Membership fees, donations, grants and vending
			machines. We use this money to provide and improve our Port Hack Campus, as well as purchase tools (from
			hammers to lathes) and shared services (like welding gas)
			</p>

			<p>
			We have people interested in: programming, linux, security, micro-controllers, arduinos,
			electronics, firmware, software, RC-flying (helis and planes), UAV's, cars, mechatronics,
			robotics, 3D printing, PCB-etching, metal-casting, woodworking, and more.
			</p>

			<h3>What is HSBNE's culture?</h3>
			<p>
			The basic tenets of HSBNE's culture can be boiled down to two major points:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Be excellent to each other.</li>
				<li>HSBNE is a Do-ocracy, the best person to effect change is yourself.</li>
			</ul>
