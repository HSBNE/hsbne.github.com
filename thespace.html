            Our campus includes two buildings with an enclosed undercover courtyard on a 3,500m<sup>2</sup> plot. We have a general work room, a classroom, dedicated rooms for Digital Fabrication and geeky Crafts, the Boneyard full of scavengable parts, as well as dedicated Woodworking and Metal working rooms. We're located in an industrial area right next door to <a href="https://eatstreetmarkets.com/">Eat Street Markets</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            If you're having trouble finding us, our phone number is (07) 3180 3142. Keep in mind that this is just the number for our building so it will only be answered when members are on site, and members can only give assistance in locating us, not answering other questions. For all other queries including media, donations & official business, <a href="http://hsbne.org/contact.html">get in touch with our Executive</a>.

        <p>
            Make your way onto the ICB Northbound, follow through onto Kingsford Smith Drive. Take a right at Remora Rd, and a left at the first roundabout, onto MacArthur Ave. Continue past the first (and only) left hand turn (Barcham St) and turn right into our driveway just past that. Our driveway is beside the big trees in the middle of the road, next to a big blue sign. We share our driveway with one of the car parks for Eat Street Markets. We have on-site parking plus plenty of street parking.

            The nearest CityCat terminal is the Northshore Hamilton CityCat terminal, around 800m away. Once you arrive, walk up the ramp & through the park, turn left and walk about 300m past the really TALL shed and car park. The space is the first driveway on your left.

        </ul>
        This is the shortest quickest way there from the city, with a bit of traffic, pedestrians with a mix of bike lanes & main roads. Mostly flat terrain and if you're comfortable riding on main roads, will get you here the quickest.
