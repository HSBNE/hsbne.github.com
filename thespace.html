        Our campus includes two buildings with an enclosed courtyard on a 3,500m<sup>2</sup> plot. We are located in The Factories, which is right next to Eat St. Google Maps finds us best but here are some suggestions: We recommend you <a href="https://hsbnetour.eventbrite.com.au/">book in for a tour</a> on a tuesday open night.

                </ul>
                Make your way onto the ICB Northbound, follow through onto Kingsford Smith Drive. Take a right at Remora Rd, and a left at the first roundabout, onto MacArthur Ave. Continue past the first (and only) left hand turn (Barcham St) and turn right into our driveway just past that. Our driveway is beside the big trees in the middle of the road, next to a big blue sign. We share our driveway with one of the car parks for Eat Street Markets. We have on-site parking plus plenty of street parking.

                    The nearest CityCat terminal is the Northshore Hamilton CityCat terminal, around 800m away. Once you arrive, walk up the ramp & through the park, turn left and walk about 300m past the really TALL shed and car park. The space is the first driveway on your left.

                <p>
                    The nearest bus stop is Stop 20 at Racecourse Road, Hamilton Central which is serviced by the 300 bus, or Stop 25/15 at Lancaster Rd, Ascot which is serviced by the 301 bus. Both are around 2km away; the easiest way to find directions to us from those stops is to just look at the linked maps.

                This is the shortest quickest way there from the city, with a bit of traffic, pedestrians with a mix of bike lanes & main roads. Mostly flat terrain and if you're comfortable riding on main roads, will get you here the quickest.
