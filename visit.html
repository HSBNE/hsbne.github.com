    Our campus includes two buildings with an enclosed courtyard on a 3,500m<sup>2</sup> plot. We are located in The Factories, which is right next to Eat St. Google Maps finds us best but here are some suggestions: We recommend you <a href="https://hsbnetour.eventbrite.com.au/">book in for a tour</a> on a tuesday open night.

    <ol>
      <li>Make your way onto the ICB Northbound, follow through onto Kingsford Smith Drive.</li>
      <li>Take a right at Remora Rd, and a left at the traffic lights, onto MacArthur Ave.</li>
      <li>Head east for roughly 900m and turn right into our driveway (look for big trees in the middle of the road).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We share our driveway with one of the car parks for Eat Street Markets. Look for a stack of shipping containers on our corner displaying a solar powered car.</p>
    <p>We have on-site parking off the MacArthur Ave driveway plus additional parking adjacent to Eat Street's car park on the river side of HSBNE.</p>

    <p>This is the shortest quickest way there from the city with a bit of traffic, pedestrians and a mix of bike lanes and main roads. Mostly flat terrain and if you're comfortable riding on main roads is the most efficient route. </p>
