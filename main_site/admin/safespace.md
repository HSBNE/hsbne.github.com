### HSBNE is a Safe Space

#### Policy

HSBNE Inc strives to be an inclusive and safe space for all to participate in.
We believe that in the absense of true equality in our society, we should aim
to provide equity to our members and the participating public. We are not a
judge and jury, we are not the cops; but we are a community with shared ideals
about the rights of people to feel free of oppression.

Abuse, discrimination, harassment, assault, sexism, racism, ableism, religious
persecution and homophobic behaviour is not tolerated at HSBNE Inc, nor is any
other behavior which would reasonably make a person feel trivialised or
otherwise discriminated against. Anyone violating this may be asked to leave
the hackerspace either temporarily or permanently.

This process is not easy. Please question in advance your capacity to deal with
being asked to leave the  hackerspace if necessary and how you would react in a
progressive way if you or yours were called out for behaviour in violation of
this document.

Alcohol and other drugs are not an excuse for bad behaviour. While we recognise
the difficulties imposed by mental health and/or other disabilities, these
issues are not an excuse for bad behaviour either. Everyone can expect to be held
accountable of their behaviour equally. We ask that you be aware of your
capacity to remain in control of your emotions, actions and reactions when these
things come into play.

If you experience or witness any behaviour that crosses the boundaries and ideas
in this document, challenge them. If you act contrary to this document, expect
to be challenged.

Actions contrary to this document are an acceptable reason to utilise our dispute
resolution process.

1.  We all enter the hackerspace with a commitment to mutual respect, mutual aid,
    anti-oppression advocacy, conflict resolution, non-violence and community
    building.
2.  We respect everyone's names, preferred gender pronouns, expressed identities
    and experiences. We avoid making assumptions, promote mutual appreciation and
    understand that no one is required to share information about their identites or
    experiences.
3.  We support the empowerment of each person and strive to continually
    acknowledge the histories and structures of oppression that marginalize some and
    divide us all.
4.  We commit to making the hackerspace as accessible as possible; physically,
    socially, and personally.
5.  We do not engage in violence or threats.
6.  We obtain explicit consent for physical contact or using others' belongings.
7.  We recognise that certain behaviour and language can act as a trigger for individuals,
    such as trivialising, joking about or dismissing someone's thoughts or experiences.
8.  We believe in stepping back and letting people and groups explain and
    conceive their own needs and requirements, and respect their choices and
    experiences.
9.  We accept a shared responsibility where we hold ourselves and one another
    accountable to these agreements, without violence, judgment, or assumption of
    intent.
10. We support the concept of freedom of speech, and aim to avoid all forms of
    censorship. However, we do not support freedom from consequence. Your free
    speech may incur consequences such as (but not limited to) moderation, being
    included in a dispute process, temporary or permanent loss of membership, etc.
11. We do not support utilising the hackerspace for sexual activity.
12. We ask that people utilising the hackerspace also utilise the bathrooms when
    changing clothes, as this may make some people feel uncomfortable or unwelcome.
13. We promote inclusive learning spaces. We encourage anyone who is feeling
    less than familiar with terminology, concepts or context to ask questions in the
    spirit of personal growth.


#### Terminology

HSBNE Inc defines various terms in our safe space policy as such:

Oppression
: A system of power that seeks to keep people separate and subordinate based on
diversity or diversities from the mainstream authority. Also known as systematic
discrimination of a group.

Mainstream Authority
: The group considered 'normal' in a given culture. In Australia, this group is
loosly defined as caucasian, heterosexual, cisgendered males.

Sexism
: Oppression of a group of people based on their gender or sex.

Racism
: Oppression of a group of people based on their race, ethnicity or culture.

Ableism
: Oppression of a group of people based on their ability or disability to
perform certain tasks.

Homophobic Behaviour
: Oppression of a group of people based on their sexual orientation or
preferences.

Religious Persecution
: Oppression of a group of people based on their membership to a religious
organisation.

Discrimination
: Prejudicial treatment of an individual or group based on their actual or
percieved membership in a certain oppressed group or category.

Cisgender
: A person whose gender identity matches with the sex they are designated at birth.

Trigger
: A topic, phrase or word that emotionally sets someone off. Could refer to anger,
or reliving a traumatic experience. They are not the same as being reminded of
something someone does not like, or take offense to.
