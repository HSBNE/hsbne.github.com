# Dress and Presentation

HSBNE is a group made up of people from diverse walks of life. We want to celebrate that, and definitely dont expect you to turn up in a tie. However, for the safety and comfort of everyone there are some minimum standards you should adhere to.

1. Please remain completely clothed at all times. This means shoes, pants, shirt at a minimum.
2. The clothes must be of reasonable quality, ie no large holes, recently washed.
3. If you need to change, use the bathrooms.
4. Avail yourself of the use of deoderant. We recognise sometimes its sweaty work so come as prepared as possible.

Keep in mind that HSBNE is a workspace. As such, where directed you will be expected to wear appropriate protective wear, such as fully enclosed footwear.
