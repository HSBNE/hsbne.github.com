# Large Projects

Occasionally, people come to HSBNE to work on something BIG. This is awesome. 
In order to make sure everyone has a good outcome, you need to be aware of 
and follow the process in this policy.

## What is Large?

If you cant fit it in any of the appropriate areas inside on site, and it must
be stored outside, it counts as a 'Large Project'. Historically this has been things like

* Art Installations
* Mobile Homes and Trailers
* Vehicle modifications

etc...

### The Process

1. Put up a proposal on the forum detailing your project. Put up pictures! You must
   clearly state these points:
   * What it would cost to get it removed offsite. For a vehicle, this is towing costs. If
     you abandon your project your deposit will be used to remove the project from HSBNE.
   * Your timeline for completion
2. Take it to a meeting agenda, just post up a link to your build log in an agenda thread and
   let everyone know you're looking for large project approval.
3. Go to the meeting! Talk about your project, let people ask questions. If its a good fit for
   HSBNE then people will approve it.
4. Once its approved, email executive@hsbne.org and they will provide you with a google document
   you can fill out. It's the same thing as your forum post so copy and paste with abandon. If
   you can speak about how your project expands hsbnes mission/vision/values/goals, it makes it
   easier to argue the case with the landlord etc.
5. The executive will take your document to the property manager who will take it to the landlord.
6. If the landlord okays the project, you can bring it on site and begin once you pay any agreed
   deposit.
   
### Warning

This process is _slow_. It can take up to 3 months for this to play out, depending on how busy
volunteers are and how prompt the landlord process goes. Do not make your plans around instant
approval, or rely on HSBNE for anything on a critical timeline.

### Commercial Projects

If your project is commercial in nature, ie you are funded by external capital, have employees you
are paying, or you are profitable. (ie, if you're not a bootstrapped startup), this will affect your
project. You will/may be asked to:

* Become a HSBNE Sponsor in membership level, OR
* Pay any other appropriate corporate membership.
* Take on extra stipulations as asked in negotiations with landlord etc.

At no point in the process is approval guaranteed, so have a backup plan.
