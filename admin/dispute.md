Bad behaviour at HSBNE is unacceptable. By being a part of our community you
give up certain freedoms in order for our community to run smoothly.

When a member does something against the ethos or community of HSBNE, they will
be issued an *infraction*.

An *infraction* is a publicly posted notification of bad behaviour. If a member
accumulates a significant amount of *infractions* over a period of time, *infractions*
will be used as the justification and documentation for them being asked to leave the HSBNE
community.

Posting an *infraction* is:

* At the discretion of the executive.
* Requires an executive majority vote.
* Includes a clear documentation of the unacceptable behaviour.
* Is always to the official communications medium of the group as decided by the executive.

The general membership may request the executive issue an *infraction* by following these points.

* Two members, one to raise and one to second the *infraction*.
* Reasonable documentation (proof) of the action.
* Both members agree to have their names publicised against the *infraction* as the requesters.

Issuing *infractions* should not be avoided, but they are not for minor issues.
They are serious documentation of unacceptable behaviour.

The executive commits to pursuing alternative forms of rectification where appropriate,
such as private conversations with member or utilising online communication moderation tools, 
before moving to issue an *infraction*.

#### Examples of behaviour against the ethos and community of HSBNE

* A member creates a large mess and does not clean up after themselves.
* A member harasses, attacks or abuses another member.
* A member creates an unsafe environment for other members via their actions.
* A member contravenes our behavioural guidelines, such as the Safe Space Policy.

This list is non-exhaustive, and is for examples only.

#### Examples of behaviour that should be solved without an *infraction*

* Disagreements or arguments online.
* Minor behavioural quirks that can be effectively solved with a private chat.
