* Agenda Item: Amending Management Committee Maximum Term
  All voted in favour of amending rule 18 (5) to read “A member may not hold the same position on the management committee for more than 2 consecutive years.”

* Agenda Item: Conflicts of Interest.
  A conflict of interest was determined to be when you are making a profit from the group. Tabled for voting at the AGM.

* Agenda Item: New Dispute Resolution System (Red Card/Yellow Card).
  There was general agreeance on the concept but that the specifics need to be decided on.

  - Members vouching for new members after several visits.
