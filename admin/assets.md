# Assets

## Summary

HSBNE has grown to a size where tracking our assets has become critical for financial
and safety reasons.

## Human Version

* Assets need to be
  * Documented in the wiki,
  * Be tested and tagged
  * In the asset register
* Don't throw broken things in the bin, they need to go through end-of-lifecycle so we can
  make sure its not repairable and strike it from registers as broken.
* When we sell things, it has to go to a vote where we decide the price, where the proceeds
  go, etc.
* Once sold, all money has to go through the treasurer to be properly accounted.
* Donations have to be accepted or rejected by executive or team leads.
* Members must wait for explicit rejection to claim donations.
* The person accepting a donation is responsible for the item. That means they have to follow
  through and get it working, installed, WAD etc. (Or find someone who will).
* Loaned items need to have an agreement signed so that everyone is clear on expectations.
* Loaned items may be considered abandoned if the owner becomes uncontactable.
