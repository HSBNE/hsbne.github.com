# Assets

## Summary

HSBNE has grown to a size where tracking our assets has become critical for financial
and safety reasons.

## Human Version

* Assets need to be 
  * Documented in the wiki, 
  * Be tested and tagged
  * In the asset register
* Don't throw broken things in the bin, they need to go through end-of-lifecycle so we can
  make sure its not repairable and strike it from registers as broken.
* When we sell things, it has to go to a vote where we decide the price, where the proceeds
  go, etc.
* Once sold, all money has to go through the treasurer to be properly accounted.

## Rules Version

        such as extension leads and powerboards, which could be considered consumable, must
        be tracked.
