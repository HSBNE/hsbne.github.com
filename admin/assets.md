# Assets

HSBNE has grown to a size where tracking our assets has become critical for financial
and safety reasons. To this end:

1. An asset is an item considered non-consumable, that stays on site. This means any 
   machine, a handheld tool, equipment etc. The exception to this is all electrical items
   such as extension leads and powerboards, which could be considered consumable, must
   be tracked.
2. All assets must be tracked appropriately in the asset register.  
   2.1 Assets must display somewhere the barcode or identification that corresponds with
       the register.
3. The asset register is managed by the Vice President, who is responsible for its upkeep
   and accuracy.  
   3.1 The Vice President can delegate this responsibility
4. All machine assets and or stationary workstations composed of a set of assets, must
   have appropriate documentation on the wiki  
   4.1 Risk assessments and controls must be implemented and documented in the wiki prior 
       to general availability.
5. All electrical assets brought on site, without exception, must be tested and tagged
   before deployment/implementation/usage.  
   5.1 Test & Tag tags must remain on assets.  
   5.2 Assets must be retested at appropriate intervals  
   5.3 Assets without Test & Tag tags, or expired tags, must be controlled per the 
       electrical safety policy  
6. Assets with valuations above $250 must be registered with the Treasurer as part of
   our financial reporting.
7. Assets that fail, break or are otherwise unusable must not be thrown into the trash,
   but surrendered to an appropriate location for end of life-cycle process.
