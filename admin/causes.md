Causes are micro groups within HSBNE that are empowered to direct funds towards
their own interests without having to convince merit to the group as a whole. In
exchange for autonomy, Causes take some responsibility for the upkeep and
community building of the hackerspace.

This means that (for example) a group of blacksmithers can direct funds
specifically towards their interests (ie a new anvil) without having to convince
the wider group of its merit as an expenditure. It means they can maintain their
area and buy appropriate consumables for it.

### The one big caveat

When total funds of the hackerspace drop below the marker defined by the
Treasurer, all cause fund allocation freezes until the general bank balance
recovers.

This marker is currently defined as *$10,000*

### As a cause member

You may allocate up to *25%* in total, of your monthly dues, towards up to *Three* causes,
which gains you membership in those causes and voting rights. You can change
these allocations once per month by contacting the Treasurer and notifying them
of your preferences.

### As a cause leader

#### Minimum Requirements

At a minimum, to exist a cause must have:

1. One leader
2. Five members total
3. Committed to the contribution rules
4. Approval from an executive majority vote
5. Registered themselves with the Treasurer
6. A wiki page (on the HSBNE domain) stating
  * The current leader.
  * The cause objectives.
  * Causes contribution details (classes, area of upkeep etc).

#### Cause Contributions

Causes must contribute back to the hackerspace as defined by the executive.
Failure to meet these obligations in a calendar month will result in no funds
being allocated for that month and shutdown of the area. The current rules for contribution are:

1. One **unique** class run per 10 cause members per month.
   * ie: 10 members = 1 class, 11 members = 2 classes.
   * **Unique** means separate classes, not repeating the same class. ie: lathe
     use and welding, or intro to soldering and oscilloscope 101
2. Obligation to ‘own’ a physical area of the hackerspace and be responsible for
   its upkeep and appearance.
3. Grants specifically for the cause must also have some contribution to the
   hackerspace as a whole.

##### How is upkeep managed?

The area defined for upkeep gets cleaned and approved by a member of the exec as
acceptable. Photos are taken as a reference. Each month a walkthrough will be
performed to grade the area against the reference photos. No walkthrough report
means no funds allocated for that month and shutdown of the area until grievance is resolved.

#### Cause Rules

Operation of a cause is bound by similar rules as the group as a whole. When in
doubt, read our incorporation rules and follow them. The relevant clarifications
are:

1. Quorum is defined as minimum 3 people or 40% of cause membership, whichever
   is greater.
2. The cause leader has a discretionary amount as determined by the Treasurer.
   (Currently *$100/m* but can not exceed cause balance)
3. Causes may (at the discretion of the treasurer) accept contributions from
   sources other than membership fee alotments.
4. Causes meetings may only vote on items relating to the expenditure of a
   causes balance.

Otherwise, a cause operates as does the larger group, to highlight a few key
points:

1. The requirements for meetings to vote on decisions with:
  * Quorum at a meeting.
  * Adequate public notice.
  * Minutes accessible to HSBNE membership.
2. Five days notice to HSBNE members for financial meeting items.

### Causes are not Silos

A cause empowers you and people with similar interests to direct funds
appropriately within your own consensus. It does not, in any way allow you to:

* Deny general membership access to a cause maintained area
* Deny non cause members to any meetings, equipment, tools, consumables or classes.

### Legal Mumbo Jumbo

For the purposes of our incorporation rules, causes are defined as
subcommittees.

### Lets do this!

To start a cause, [contact the executive](mailto:executive@hsbne.org) with:

* The name of the leader
* The first five members
* Planned class(es)
* Proposed area of upkeep.
