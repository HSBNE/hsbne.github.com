    <h3><a href="/admin/rules.html">Group Rules</a></h3>
    <p>The HSBNE bible, as it were. Our group rules are a fairly well modified version of the Model Rules for Incorporation. When in doubt, refer to these. Any member is welcome to raise a change to these at a meeting, however it costs HSBNE a nominal fee to re-file.</p>
    <h3><a href="/admin/policy.html">Policies</a></h3>
    <p>We have a number of non official but enforced guidelines within the group. These are typically the result of a meeting.</p>
    <h3><a href="/admin/costs.html">Ongoing Costs</a></h3>
    <p>The Executive tries to keep any ongoing cost commitments by HSBNE documented here.</p>
    <h3><a href="/admin/exechistory.html">Executive History</a></h3>
    <p>The history of members who have dedicated their time to making HSBNE run.</p>
