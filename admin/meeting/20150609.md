## Knowledge Transfer Meeting Notes

Advice from previous Executive:
- Get along, communicate well.
- Use executive mailing list in all communications via email for transparency 
- Executive meetings must stay on track, and task orientated.  Stressed that secretary can delegate note taking, especially to more than one person.
