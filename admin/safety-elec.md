# Electrical Safety & Faults at HSBNE

HSBNE Prioritises safety, especially electrical safety. To give clear requirements / procedure,
this policy outlines expectations and steps.

## 1. Unsafe electrical

1.1. Unsafe electrical is any exposed voltage above Extra Low Voltage as defined by AS/NZS 3000:2000  
1.2. All unsafe electrical must be **immediately controlled**.  
1.3. Controlled means removed from public areas, documented, and or locked out. A controlled item
     cannot be energised. If it can be energised, it is not controlled.  
1.4. Interlocks can lock-out machines via software, however this is not sufficient control as
     mechanical or software failure may re-energise the item.  
     
## 2. Procedure for controlling unsafe electrical

2.1. Unplug from any power, fully deenergise. Wait for 5min before continuing to deenergise any
     capacitance. Do not leave item unattended. Continue.  
2.2. The item must be controlled:  
     2.2.1 If a physical lockout can be applied (ie, a padlock on the plug) then apply.  
     2.2.2 If a physical lockout cannot be applied, the plug must be removed and secured in 
           a surrender bin or the server room.  
     2.2.3 Where appropriate, the item can wholely be secured either in a surrender bin, or
           in a non public area, such as the server room.  
     2.2.4 Items may not be placed into the trash uncontrolled, for example, a frayed extension 
           lead. This is because there is potential for it to be taken from trash and used.  
2.3. The executive must be informed by email.  
2.4. The membership must be informed by a forum post.  
2.5. The item must have an orange ticket applied securely with tape. Where possible to cover
     primary controls such as on/off switches.  
2.6. The item must have warning tags from lockout kit applied.  

## 3. Procedure for reinstating a controlled electrical item

3.1. If repairable:  
     3.1.1. Only qualified electrical contractor may assess and repair a faulted item.  
     3.1.2. Once repaired, item must be Tested & Tagged again.  
     3.1.3. Item can be returned to service.  
3.2. If non repairable:  
     3.2.1. Item will be rendered safe by removing plugs etc.  
     3.2.2. Item will be placed in appropriate final bin, such as site skip or e-waste.  

## 4. Access to Circuit Breakers and Boards.

Sometimes, circuits can trip. If a circuit is tripped, a person may need to access a
circuit breaker. When doing this, this procedure must be followed.

4.1. Assess what breaker has tripped.
4.2. To reset the breaker:  
     4.2.1. Attempt to reenable breaker.  
     4.2.2. If breaker trips immediately, assess for electrical fault items and follow
            procedure.  
     4.2.3. Once faulted item is controlled, start again from 4.1.  
     4.2.3. If breaker continues to trip, leave tripped and continue to next steps.  
4.4. Notify the appropriate parties:  
     4.4.1. Executive must be emailed  
     4.4.2. Membership must be notified by forum post  
4.5. All access and changes to a power board _must_ be reported, even in the case of
     'nuisance' trips.  
     
## 5. Faults in fixed electrical.

5.1. Where fixed electrical faults are identified, such as damaged outlets, fixed wiring
     etc, persons onsite must:  
5.2. Access the relevant powerboard and circuit breaker to deenergise the circuit.  
     5.2.1. In some cases, the powerboard may not be accessible. In this scenario proceed
            carefully and safely through subsequent steps.  
5.3. Where safe to do so, secure the fault with an orange ticket and tape.  
5.4. Attach an orange ticket inside the powerboard to identify why the circuit is de-energised.  
5.5. Notify the appropriate parties:  
     5.5.1. Executive must be emailed  
     5.5.2. Membership must be notified by forum post
