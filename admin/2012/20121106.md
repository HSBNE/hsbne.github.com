* Item 1: Port Hack Budgeting. The group voted for the new budget to be set at $1500 with no reimbursements that would take us above that. 13 for, 1 against.
* Item 2: Reimbursements for materials on the weekend. All were in favour for reimbursing Eric for $150 for the running of his water blasting equipment over the cleanup days. A vote was then held regarding reimbursements consisting of the following:

  * Sidney W  $100 for termite poison.
  * Joshua H- $150 for tools used on the weekend (kneepads, scrapers, etc), $218 in wood for replacing termite eaten doorframes.

  * James B - $70 for the staminade drinks used on the days.

  All in all, the group voted to reimburse all of this.
