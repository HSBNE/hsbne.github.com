1. members voted in-favour of allowing *outside* parking at the HSBNE when said vehicle-parking members are *NOT* present, ONLY IF ONE OF: 

  * you leave your phone number on the dash of the car, so you can be called to move the car ( if needed), AND you are available to move your card in a reasonable time ( an hour or less ) . 
  OR
  * you leave your keys in an agreed place inside HSBNE, so other members can more the vehicle if it become a problem ( you do this at your own risk, and other members moving your car do so with your permission and risk if you do this ) 

  If you are not happy with either of these condition/s you MAY NOT park your car in the outside area, above the HSBNE building ( inside the fence ) . 

2. Lemming raised that the previously voted on ( and agreed vote ) "contracted rubbish bin" ( which was approx $36/mo )  can not be done for any contract length lessd than 12 months , so members agreed that 12 months was acceptable,. so long as it was transferrable to a new site.
