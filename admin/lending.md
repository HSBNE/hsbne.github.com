    * You have to ask the appropriate team lead, or if none, the executive.
    * There must be a loan agreement signed
    * The asset must be documented before/after with pictures or video
    * The loan will be tracked by the asset register
    * You will be required to make good on any damage or issues, and if a bond is taken, that may be
      used to make good the item
* If you're a team member, you can take items off site for maintenance/repair reasons. You must:
    * Get the ok from team lead
    * Create a maintenance item in the asset register stating you're taking it offsite, with expected return date.
