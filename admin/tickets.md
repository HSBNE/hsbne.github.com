## Overview

The ticket system at HSBNE exists to help members bring some semblance of control to the utter Capital-C Chaos that hackerspaces tend to be. All tickets must be digitally issued (e.g. via a HSBNE kiosk or app). If a legitimate technical issue prevents a ticket from being digitally issued, they may be issued by hand.

<h2>Doom Shelf Ticket </h2>

<p>
Any item left unattended in a shared workspace for more than one hour and does not have a valid Green Ticket may be relocated to the Doom Shelves.</p>

<p>HSBNE equipment should not be left in shared work spaces or the Doom Shelves. Equipment should be put back in their designated homes.</p>

<p>Items entering the Doom Shelves must be photographed and a Doom Shelf Ticket (sticker) must be applied. After 2 weeks in the Doom Shelves, the item will be treated as a donation to HSBNE and may be hacked on or disposed of by any member.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success"><h2>Green Ticket (Parking Permit)</h2>

A Green Ticket is required if you wish to temporarily leave your project at HSBNE. You are required to follow the conditions outlined on the Green Ticket when it is issued. Items requiring longer than one month need a forum post to be made about them as they are clearly that awesome.

<div class="alert alert-danger"><h2>Red Ticket (Parking Ticket)</h2>

<p>A Red Ticket is a 2 week grace period warning that the item(s) in question are not stored appropriately. If the owner does not rectify the issue(s) within 14 days, the items may be hacked on, or disposed of by any member.</p>
  
<b>Note: </b>Red Tickets are not applied to items in shared work spaces. See Doom Shelves above.</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><h2>Orange Ticket (Borked or Broken)</h2>

<p>Sometimes equipment breaks, or it becomes partially functional. Orange Tickets indicate what is wrong and who found or broke it. They also state if this tool should not be used, or if it can be used but has some unexpected quirks, such as a dead channel on an oscilloscope.</p>

Members are required to issue an Orange Ticket for any equipment they break, or find broken, if it does not already have one. Members must read any Orange Tickets in full before attempting to use equipment with one.
