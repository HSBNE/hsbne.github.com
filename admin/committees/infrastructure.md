# Infrastructure Committee

### Goal
The primary goal of the infrastructure committee is to ensure HSBNE infrastructure is kept secure and up to date, adequately maintained, and fit for purpose to ensure efficient operations and site security.

### Tasks
The primary task of the infrastructure committee is to develop, install, and maintain the physical or digital infrastructure and services needed for the efficient operation of HSBNE.

### Members and Roles
The specific roles defined below are nothing more than an official title with suggested areas of oversight. Members of this committee have equal say in all decisions. Roles and titles may be added or removed by the committee.

##### Head of digital infrastructure
This role oversees most digital related things such as the membership portal, access system, home assistant instance, operating systems and/or HSBNE servers, and other software.


##### Head of physical infrastructure
This role oversees most physical related things such as door and interlock controls, physical networking (e.g. WiFi and switches) and site security.

##### Executive Liason
This role acts as a bridge between the executive committee and the infrastructure committee. This person is expected to keep each committee up to date with relevant infrastructure matters. It is recommended that one member of the executive be part of this committee so they can perform this role.

### Powers & Rules
**“Core infrastructure”** - is defined as anything vital for HSBNE to function. To make it absolutely clear, the following is a non-exhaustive list of current core infrastructure: membership portal, access system (doors & interlocks), internet connection, site WiFi and IP network, and the CCTV system. 

**"Active Role"** - For the purpose of these committee rules, a member has an active role in HSBNE infrastructure if they meet any of the following requirements:
* Over the last 3 months they have contributed at least 5 hours to maintaining core HSBNE infrastructure.
* They are the primary maintainer of at least one piece of core infrastructure.

To be eligible to sit on this committee, a member must have an active role in HSBNE infrastructure (unless they are acting as the executive liason). For future reference, this is to avoid the "too many cooks in the kitchen" anti pattern that has surface numerous times in the past.

The quorum required for any major decision is two members of this committee. Any member of this committee can make minor decisions (such as moving a WiFi access point, adding a feature to the portal etc).

If there is disagreement between members of this committee, any committee member can request a formal vote between themselves or request one at a general meeting.

This committee can:

* Make decisions and create by-laws (ie policies) that directly assist them with their goals and tasks, however the following applies:
  * A vote at a general or executive meeting can override any decision or policy.
  * The outcome of any major decisions (e.g. changing the WiFi password) should be posted on the official communications medium.
  * Any decision that is likely to impact more than a reasonable number of members must be made public prior to going into effect, and include a reasonable consultation period.
  * This committee must have at least 3 members to be able to vote on motions.
* Ask other members to assist them with tasks or projects.
* Restrict who is allowed to complete **specific** tasks or projects associated with HSBNE core infrastructure or if they reasonably believe the outcome may have an impact on the reliability of HSBNE infrastructure. (ie preventing someone from contributing at all is not ok, but preventing them from doing something dodgy to our access system is fine)
* Spend the budget in the way as defined below.

### Budget
The infrastructure committee shall have a $100/mth non accumulative budget to assist them with completing their goals and tasks. This may be "rolled over" for up to 3 months in order to complete bigger purchases but a unanimous decision is required for this. All other purchases must be approved by a majority. All purchases must be for the sole purpose of assisting the committee with completing their goals and tasks.
