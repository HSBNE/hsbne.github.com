# Membership

## Introduction
The HSBNE Inc. constitution allows the management committee to create policies around the process of handling new memberships, fees/dues, the admission/rejection of new memberships, terminating memberships and various other minor things. This document clarifies various procedures and rules. It also documents the executive’s interpretation of the constitution where applicable.

## Definitions
**Interested Person -** someone who isn’t a member but is interested in becoming one.

**Tour -** an unofficial process of introducing a non-member to HSBNE and explaining what we have to offer, how the membership process works etc.

**Written notice -** a formal notice that can be delivered via email, discord or in person.

## New Memberships
This section is relevant to section (6) and (8) of our constitution. 

Whilst HSBNE is in Hibernation Mode, the normal process for a new person or previous member to become a member has been suspended. A [Hibernation Fee Structure](#hibernation-fee-structure) has been established to allow members to continue their membership and support the organisation until a new campus is established, and normal operations can resume. 

During this time, prospective new members or supporters should:
1. attend a HSBNE social or general meeting, which are currently held on [Discord](https://chat.hsbne.org/) every Tuesday evening at 8pm. 
2. sign up via our member portal [\(https://portal.hsbne.org\)](https://portal.hsbne.org).
3. pay their nominated support level fees in full and give written notice to the treasurer that they are a new member and have just made their initial payment.

Once the above process has been completed, the interested person becomes a member of the organisation as defined in our constitution. No access cards are currently being issued, however members can check their membership status via the [Portal](https://portal.hsbne.org). Note that the executive can reject an application for any reason.

## Membership Fees and Payments
This section is relevant to section (7) of our constitution. All membership levels at HSBNE receive the same voting rights. The different support levels are designed to allow equitable membership to HSBNE Inc for everyone.

### Payments
HSBNE operates on a monthly membership period. Your membership fees are due on the 1st of each month and must be paid for in advance. At the treasurer's discretion, your membership will be suspended if you don’t make a payment on time and your membership can be terminated if you become 14 days or more in arrears. If you make a written request to the Treasurer prior to the due date, they can use their discretion to extend these time periods.


### Hibernation Fee Structure ###
The Hibernation Fee Structure applies until HSBNE has re-established a functioning campus. At this time, the fee structure will be either revert to the legacy fee structure, or be revised to suit the new operating model. Any changes will be voted on by members at a future General Meeting. See [https://forum.hsbne.org/](https://forum.hsbne.org/) for further information and discussion.


#### Support Level 1: \$100 per month ####

#### Support Level 2: \$50 per month ####

#### Support Level 3: \$25 per month ####

#### Support Level 4: \$0 per month ####

#### Transition Arrangements ####
Current members will be transitioned to the new support level corresponding to their current membership status in accordance with the following scheme.
1. All current membership tiers are eliminated
2. All memberships under $30 are moved directly to level 3 $25
3. All legacy hackers and volunteers discounts are moved directly to level 2 $50
4. All general membership at $100 are moved directly to level 1 $100
5. Existing special arrangements with individual members will be managed by the Committee on a case by case basis. 
6. Once the new tier is online, members can change to other support tiers at their discretion via the portal.

#### Lifetime Membership
Lifetime Members are members of HSBNE who have either accrued 10 years of membership or paid up in advance to accrue 10 years of membership. Lifetime Members do not have to pay for membership to maintain their voting/access rights. Paying in advance is calculated as 

    ( ( 10 * 12 ) - <accrued membership in months> ) * 55

## Terminating Memberships
This section is relevant to section (9) of our constitution. There are various ways a membership may be terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily.

### Voluntary Termination
A member must give the executive a written notice of their intention to terminate their membership. If no date or time is specified in the written notice, then it is assumed to take effect immediately. All membership fees will be forfeited and no partial refunds will be given.

### Involuntary Termination
The executive can decide to terminate a membership if the member is convicted of an indictable offence, breaches an HSBNE rule or policy, has membership fees in arrears or conducts themselves in a way that’s detrimental to the association.

Before the executive terminates a membership, they should give the member a fair opportunity to show why their membership should not be terminated. The executive interprets “every opportunity to pay arrears or apply for fees to be waived” as up to 14 days after the due date. It is deemed that every opportunity has been given if arrangements or full payment is not made within 14 days after the due date.

The Executive should give written notice to the member as soon as practical after the executive decides an outcome. The outcome and any information deemed reasonably necessary for context will be made available to the general membership via the official communications platform. If the member wishes to appeal, they must give written notice within 7 days of their membership being terminated. An appeal for a termination due to substantiated claims of illegal behaviour is not available.
