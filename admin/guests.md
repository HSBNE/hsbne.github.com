# Guests at HSBNE

HSBNE is for the benefit of the community, not just its members. We allow guests on our campus and limited use of our facilities however we reserve the right to ask guests to leave at any time. This document aims to clarify the expectations and limits of being a guest at HSBNE.

### All Guests
All guests (as defined in this policy) are required to sign in using the HSBNE guest register as soon as they arrive on site. Before they leave the site they are required to sign out of the guest register.

### Unaccompanied Guests

Unaccompanied guests are non-members who attend the space when it is open to the public. For
example, during open nights or public events. They are not entitled to utilise equipment or
consumables directly, but a member may opt to assist them. Essentially, look don't touch is a fairly
simple interpretation.


### Accompanied Guests
Accompanied guests at HSBNE are non-members who attend with a currently paid up, active member. In this case, the member is responsible for all actions of the guest. For example, legal guardians with minors may fall into this category. Accompanied guests may utilise the resources that the financial member is willing to directly supervise them with, that do not require induction. Machines requiring induction must be operated by the member who has completed the training. A supervising member must directly supervise any use of HSBNE facilities by a guest.

For the purpose of this policy, directly supervise means the member must pay full attention to the guest and must be watching them at all times while they use HSBNE facilities. The member cannot use other tools/machines at the same time and they cannot be in a different area while the guest is using HSBNE facilities. A good check that youâ€™re complying with this rule is one tool/machine being used per active membership card. Reasonable exceptions to this rule must be allowed, such as when the supervising member needs to use the bathroom or grab a drink of water, etc. However, these exceptions do not apply to any machinery fitted with an interlock, and their use must be directly supervised at all times.

A member may have two (2) accompanied guests on site at any time.



### Walk in Guests

Sometimes when members attend the campus, they leave the facilities open and non-members may enter.
In the case where this happens, all members on site are responsible for the actions of the walk in
guest. If you are not comfortable with this as a member, ensure the facilities are secure to walk
ins, or ask them to reattend on an open night.

### Members of the Public whom attend Classes

Class attendees are entitled to utilise the resources that are relevant to their class. The member
running the class is responsible for the safety and security of the facilities during and after the
class, until all attendees leave the premises. When in doubt, class attendees are treated like
accompanied guests where the class runner is the responsible member.
