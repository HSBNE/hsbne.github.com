HSBNE is for the benefit of the community, not just its members. We allow guests on our campus and
limited use of our facilities. This document aims to clarify the expectations and limits of being a
guest at HSBNE.

### Unaccompanied Guests

Unaccompanied guests are non-members who attend the space when it is open to the public. For
example, during open nights or public events. They are not entitled to utilise equipment or
consumables directly, but a member may opt to assist them. Essentially, look don't touch is a fairly
simple interpretation.

We encourage repeat visits, however after three visits we reserve the right to ask you to become a
financial member or refrain from attending further.


### Accompanied Guests

Accompanied guests at HSBNE are non-members who attend with a current financial member. In this
case, the financial member is responsible for the actions of the guest. For example, Legal guardians
with minors fall into this category. Accompanied guests may utilise the resources that the financial
member is willing to supervise them with, and that the financial member themselves is entitled to
use (for example via induction).


### Walk in Guests

Sometimes when members attend the campus, they leave the facilities open and non-members may enter.
In the case where this happens, all members on site are responsible for the actions of the walk in
guest. If you are not comfortable with this as a member, ensure the facilities are secure to walk
ins, or ask them to reattend on an open night.

### Members of the Public whom attend Classes

Class attendees are entitled to utilise the resources that are relevant to their class. The member
running the class is responsible for the safety and security of the facilities during and after the
class, until all attendees leave the premises. When in doubt, class attendees are treated like
accompanied guests where the class runner is the responsible member.
