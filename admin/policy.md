## Overview
This is a master list of policies or by-laws at HSBNE that fall outside the scope of the official HSBNE Rules. These are a working part of the HSBNE infrastructure and social contract. By-laws can be made by vote at a general meeting, or by the Executive Committee[^1].

## HSBNE Meetings

 - All discussion for agenda items occurs on the forums in a relevant thread. Meetings are only for announcements, voting, thanks and project invitations/show and tell.
 - All agenda items must be posted for discussion by 8PM Thursday the week before the meeting. This allows for discussion before the meeting.
 - Before voting on Financial Agenda Items a Financial Report must be either a) read out by the Treasurer or b) provided to be read out.
One person speaks at a time. No person speaks for more than one minute when others are waiting to speak.
 - It's important to thank members who are contributing to HSBNE as we wouldn't be where we are today without it. Take the time in a meeting to thank people for excellence at HSBNE.

## Site Inductions
Before a new membership is accepted, the new member must complete a site induction as per our [general membership and payments policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lgnfvc8fAFXcWZ4Sv9Pe9AE0ctgeGFhkOuM0QbNZqM8/edit). In addition to this requirement, in order to maintain site access, a member must have successfully completed a site induction within the last 12 months. To avoid any doubt, if a member has not completed a site induction within the last 12 months, their site access may be revoked until such time that they complete a new site induction. Successfully completing a site induction for the purpose of this section, is defined in the general membership and payments policy.

HSBNE has seen an increasing number of incidents due to members forgetting our rules and procedures, or not keeping up to date with them. This section is intended to reduce the number of these incidences and create a better environment for everyone.
 
## Site Sign In Register
As soon as practical, once a member is on site they must sign into the site. When a member leaves, they must also sign out of the site. To sign into or out of site, the green room kiosk must be used. If a technical problem prevents the kiosk from working, a member may use the paper sheet next to it to sign in/out.

Access to HSBNE facilities may be restricted until a member has signed in.

## Lifetime Membership

Lifetime Members are members of HSBNE who have either accrued 10 years of membership or paid up in advance to accrue 10 years of membership. Lifetime Members do not have to pay for membership to maintain their voting/access rights. Paying in advance is calculated as 

    ( ( 10 * 12 ) - <accrued membership in months> ) * 55

## Renting

Renting was allowed by [the meeting on 30th August, 2010](/admin/meeting/20110830.html) and was revoked by [the meeting on XXth of XXXXXX](/admin/meeting/2013XXXX.md).

As such, it is HSBNE policy to disallow lease agreements for portions of the PortHack Campus.
