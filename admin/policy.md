## Overview
This is a master list of policies or by-laws at HSBNE that fall outside the scope of the official HSBNE Rules. These are a working part of the HSBNE infrastructure and social contract. By-laws can be made by vote at a general meeting, or by the Executive Committee[^1].

## HSBNE Meetings
 - All discussion for agenda items occurs on the forums in a relevant thread. Meetings are only for announcements, voting and thank yous.
 - Before voting on Financial Agenda Items a Financial Report must be either a) read out by the Treasurer or b) provided to be read out.
 - One person speaks at a time. No person speaks for more than one minute when others are waiting to speak.
 - It's important to thank members who are contributing to HSBNE as we wouldn't be where we are today without it. Take the time in a meeting to thank people for excellence at HSBNE.

## Sub-leasing
