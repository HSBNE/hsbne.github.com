HSBNE Inc. has certain restrictions that apply at our current property. This policy outlines the responsibilities that all members have to ensure we comply with our lease. It also details certain procedures around making site modifications or performing electrical work. Anyone found to be in violation of this policy will receive a ban consistent with the current ban schedule unless exceptional circumstances have occurred.

## Definitions

* Any references made to **“site”**, **“on site”**, etc. refer to the HSBNE porthack campus located in Hamilton.
* **Site modification** - is any alteration to walls, doors, fixtures, or any other part of our site that is permanent or cannot be easily reversed by any member.
* **Site Manager** - is someone who has been appointed by the landlord to act on behalf of them to help manage or maintain the site.
* **Written notice** - a formal notice that can be delivered via email, discord or in person.

# Site Modifications
* All site modifications must be authorised.
* For a site modification to be authorised, it must:
  * Have a detailed plan of execution including a timeline for completion
  * Be approved by the executive or a vote at a general meeting
  * Be approved and authorised by the landlord/site manager if necessary
  * Must be completed within the specified timeline
* Before beginning work on any site modification, written permission must be given by the executive that work may start. This is to ensure all approvals/authorisations are in place from the landlord/site manager.
* Emergency repairs are exempt from this policy when they are reasonably necessary to meet lease obligations such as security or safety. (ie a broken window may be fixed immediately)
* Small repairs such as fixing holes in walls, broken fixtures etc are permitted.

### Examples of site modifications
This is a non exhaustive list of examples that are site modifications: removing a broken air conditioning unit that was already installed when we got there, moving a light switch to somewhere more convenient, knocking down a wall, using screws or nails to attach something to a wall, painting a wall (that isn’t part of a repair), installing a set of shelves that attach to a wall, etc.

# Electrical Work
* For the purpose of this policy, “work” or “electrical work” is work related to any voltage higher than **Extra Low Voltage** as defined by AS/NZS 3000:2000 as _“voltage that does not exceed 50 volts root mean square (RMS) alternating current (**50 V AC RMS**) or 120 volts ripple-free direct current (**120 V ripple-free DC***). ”._
* Performing work related to permanent electrical infrastructure, such as moving, adding, removing or adjusting any of the following is prohibited:
  * Lighting fixtures or switches
  * Electrical sockets (GPOs)
  * Wiring or electrical board
  * Any other mains related equipment that is permanently fixed
* All licensed work must be carried out by someone who has been appointed by, or approved by the landlord or site manager.
