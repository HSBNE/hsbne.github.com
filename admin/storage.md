There are several forms of storage for members at HSBNE. The group [provides members with crated temporary project storage in the lockable storage area](/admin/meeting/20130115.html), and it also allows members to 'park' projects for specified periods of time. There are also External Storage options available.

## Members Storage

* Members are issued a single 55L black crate on starting a membership.
* Crates, once issued, are the property of their owners, and as such are not rented or leased from HSBNE.
* To ensure availability of Members Storage spots, Members should only take up one spot in members storage.
* Members who do not use members storage for a month should take their project home instead of storing it at HSBNE.
* Containers remaining after a month of inactivity from when you last swiped in to members storage or the space in general may be sent to long term storage to clear space for others to use.


## Parking Projects

Parking projects is part of the HSBNE Ticket system.

## External Storage

HSBNE does not allow any external storage of a project without going through the approval process as outlined by the Large Projects Policy.
