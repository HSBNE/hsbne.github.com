#### Be Considerate

You are sharing space and equipment and working with other HSBNE members so be considerate of how your actions affect your peers, HSBNE and the community as a whole.

#### Be Respectful

Treat one another and members of the community with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to HSBNE. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect the members of HSBNE to be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people from outside projects and initiatives. Avoid becoming involved in flame wars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments. Take the matters "outside" (off-list, etc) if it helps resolve the situation, and do not use communal methods of communication to be a vehicle for your private "wall of shame."

#### Be Collaborative

HSBNE is a community group and about collaboration and working together. Collaboration accelerates and improves the quality of our projects and helps grow the knowledge of all involved.

When you disagree, consult others. Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time, and HSBNE is no exception. Disagreement, debate and constructive criticism is often how progress is made and are a necessary part of doing complex work in a team. The important goal is not to avoid disagreements or differing views but to resolve them constructively. Above all, avoid making conflicts about the work into personal conflicts. Debate should never include reference to someone's nationality, gender, religion or other personal characteristics. You should turn to the group and to the groups processes to seek advice and to resolve disagreements.

When you are unsure, ask for help. Nobody knows everything and nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road and so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

#### Be Available

Check your e-mails and group forum regularly. If someone asks something of you, answer them promptly â€” even if it's "I'll get back to you." (Maybe not every 10 minutes, but at least every couple of days is good.)

#### Be Honest

Sometimes the hardest thing to say is "no" or admit you've forgotten do something. Be honest with each other and yourself with regards to what you say and what you can realistically commit to.

#### Follow the Rules

Members and visitors of HSBNE are expected to uphold the Group Rules.

Some HSBNE members represent the group in specific areas, but you should not speak on behalf of HSBNE or present yourself as an official representative of HSBNE unless you are specifically authorised to do so, and you should never state your opinions as the official policies of HSBNE.

#### Conflict of Interest

When using HSBNE facilities, equipment or resources or making decisions within your projects, you must do so based only on the best interests of HSBNE and its member community. If you have a situation or affiliation that might constitute or lead to a conflict of interest or might be perceived by a reasonable person in the community to be a conflict of interest, disclose this to the HSBNE Executive. If appropriate, after discussing with the Executive, you should remove yourself from specific decisions or discussions in which you may have a conflict of interest.
