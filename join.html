    Come along and meet us! We have no requirement for membership if you're visiting for a chat or tour during a scheduled open event (like our Tuesday night open nights). We ask that you join 
    when you want to contribute back to HSBNE or use any of our facilities.

      Due to the unprecedented nature of COVID-19, like most organisations, we've been impacted. We've had to reduce the frequency of public site visits and require that all guests book in for a site induction or tour in advanced.

    <h3>Ready to Join? Follow these steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Come in for a tour</strong></p>
        <p>Get a feel for us in person before joining to make sure the culture will work for you. We try to cater for many people, but the unique volunteer powered way HSBNE runs isn't for everyone. We publish most public events (including tours) on our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/HSBNE/events/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://hsbneinc.eventbrite.com.au">Eventbrite</a> pages.</p>
        <p>The executive is also responsible for vetting your membership, so we like to get to know you!</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://hsbnetour.eventbrite.com.au" class="btn btn-default page-scroll">1. Book in for a Tour</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Register an account</strong></p>
        <p>Create an account on our member portal. The member portal is the central place to manage your membership, report issues, etc. so make sure you bookmark it!</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://portal.hsbne.org/register" class="btn btn-default page-scroll">2. Register Account</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Complete a site induction</strong></p>
        <p>Once you've signed up on our <a href="https://portal.hsbne.org/">member portal</a>, you will receive an
          email from us to book in for a site induction. Site inductions are held regularly, mostly on Tuesdays at 7pm.</p>
        <p>Please bring photo ID. If you want to apply for the starving hacker membership level, you'll also need proof of your
          eligibility such as a student ID or pension card. Make sure you mention this at the start of your site induction.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Send payment to HSBNE</strong></p>
        <p>After you complete your site induction and we've accepted your membership, you will receive an invoice. You can pay for this via credit card or bank transfer. You can pay on the spot for immediate access to HSBNE facilities, or at a later date if you need some extra time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Get site access</strong></p>
        <p>After your payment has cleared (or if you pay the end of your site induction and show us the receipt) we'll activate your access card. You will be notified by email when this happens.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Our current payment system isn't linked to our access system. If your card is not enabled (because you're a new or returning member, or are catching up on overdue fees), you need to let us know when you make a payment.</p>
