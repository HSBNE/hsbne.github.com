      <p><strong>Come in for a tour</strong></p>
      <p>
        Get a feel for us in person before joining to make sure the culture will work for you. We try to cater for many people, but the unique volunteer powered way HSBNE runs isn't for everyone. We publish most public events (including tours) on our
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/HSBNE/events/">Facebook</a>
        and <a href="https://hsbneinc.eventbrite.com.au">Eventbrite</a> pages.

      <p><strong>Register an account</strong></p>
      <p>When you come to a tour at HSBNE we will give you an access card!</p>
      <p>With your access card, create an account on our member portal. The member portal is the central place to manage your membership, report issues, etc. so make sure you bookmark it! This is where you can start your membership subscription and do your general induction.</p>
