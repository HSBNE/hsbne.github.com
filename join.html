      Come along and meet us! We have no requirement for membership if you're visiting for 
      a chat or tour during a scheduled open event (like our Tuesday night open nights). 
      We ask that you join when you want to contribute back to HSBNE or use any of our facilities.

    <h3>Ready to Join? Follow these steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Come in for a tour</strong></p>
        <p>
          Get a feel for us in person before joining to make sure the culture will work for you. 
          We try to cater for many people, but the unique volunteer powered way HSBNE runs isn't 
          for everyone. We publish most public events (including tours) on our 
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/HSBNE/events/">Facebook</a> 
          and <a href="https://hsbneinc.eventbrite.com.au">Eventbrite</a> pages.
        </p>
        <p>The executive is also responsible for vetting your membership, so we like to get to know you!</p>

          With your access card, create an account on our member portal. The member portal is the central place to manage your membership, report issues, etc. so make sure you bookmark it! This is where you can start your membership subscription and do your general induction.
