#### What is it?####

a makerCamp is a showcase of inventions, creations, art, carftsmanship and anything that you can make yourself. 

There is no limit to what can be done with the application of a bit of thinking and some hard work.  The makerCamp is an opportunity to showcase some amazing projects happening in your community that you can get involved in. 

Come and see 3D printers, Electric go-carts, Electronics, Woodwork and many other "things" that people have made. 

There will be:

-     Demonstrations of projects
-     Interactive classes and projects you can try for yourself
-     Talks by some of the Inventors in Brisbane.
