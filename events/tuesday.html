    <p>
      Hackerspaces are about community, and we'd like to invite you to come visit 
      ours - free.  There's no restrictions, no fee and no "right" kind of person; 
      If you're interested we'd love to show you what we've built, what we're
      creating, and hear about what you want to make.
