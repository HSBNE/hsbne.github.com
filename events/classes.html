description: The classes at hackerspace

<p>The HackerSpace is about collaboration and part of that collaboration is sharing knowledge, both formally and informally.  
</p><p>
Members of the HackerSpace hold classes on subjects that they have a particular interest in.  The class can be of any level from beginner to advanced and could be a practical guide (e.g. setting up your first Arduino) or a demonstration of an advanced topic that you are working on (e.g. motion control algorithms). 
</p><p>
The classes will be hosted at the HackerSpace and run at a time that suites the presenter.
